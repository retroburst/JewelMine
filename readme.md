#### retroburst (Andrew D)

A simple game, reminiscent of 'Columns' on the Sega GameGear, 
written as an exercise to flex skills and try my hand at a small 
game in pure C# without using a game SDK like Unity.
I plan to re-write this in Unity as an
exercise.

The code follows simple design principles and I have endeavoured to keep
it clean and uncluttered. I have purposefully avoided using unneccessary
patterns such as dependencey injection. 

Some details:
* Built with Visual Studio Community 2013
* Music in the game was composed by Essa, used under the creative commons license - the track is "Ambient Loop 1" (https://soundcloud.com/essa-1).
* Sounds in the game were sourced from SoundBible (http://soundbible.com/) and normalised as wav files through http://www.online-convert.com/ and http://media.io.
