#JewelMine

A simple game, reminiscent of 'Columns' on the Sega GameGear, written as an exercise to flex skills and try my hand at a small game in pure C# without using a game SDK. This will hopefully give others some ideas on coding a game in C#.

-- Built with Visual Studio Community 2013
-- Music in the game was composed by Essa, who has generously made his music available under the creative commons license - the track is "Ambient Loop 1" (https://soundcloud.com/essa-1).
-- Sounds in the game were sourced SoundBible (http://soundbible.com/) and normalised as wav files through http://www.online-convert.com/ and http://media.io.
